# Lake Association Manager

## Description

_Duration: 3 Week Solo Challenge_

<!-- Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?  -->

Democratic processes can be slow and arduous when voting members of a collective donâ€™t live near each other. My application aims to be a central hub where stakeholders in a lake association can cast their vote online for proposals that will determine the governing policies of the community. Because many members live up to a hundred miles away from the lake, and 85% agreement is required for a proposal to pass, an in person voting system could be frustrating. 

With the inclusion of current social aspects, and a plan for more features in the future. The application hopes to help foster and strengthen the communial bonds needed to maintain a vibrant community.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `association_manager`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
